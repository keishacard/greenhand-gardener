## Want to create a beautiful, functional garden but donâ€™t know where to start? Gardening by theme makes planning a cinch. This application provides themes for fun gardens based on function: entertaining, cooking, or being a custodian of local ecology. The chosen theme will provide suggested plants, hardiness zones, and gardening tips.

### User Guide:
1. Register or log in with an email and password

2. Use the navigation bar to toggle between app features: Garden Themes, Editable User Gardens, Friends

3. Log out to end user session.

### Greenhand Gardener Features:

1. Garden Themes: The main dashboard after login features several prebuilt garden themes to explore and an option to build a garden independently from scratch. Select a garden theme to explore plants and tips.

2. User Gardens: Save the garden to reference later or edit to preferences or hardiness zone. Gardens can be removed from user's gardens.

3. Friends: View the gardens of friends using the app to stay inspired!
